I've been running and coaching cross country for over 10 years. For me, the best part about cross country is that it's equally a team sport and individual sport. I can run by myself whenever an opening to do so arises to release my stresses into the ether. I can wake up with a close friend before the songbirds on a early Saturday morning to share a laugh and a jog in the mountains. I can run intense intervals in a group of fifteen where we pick each other up and keep each other going, pushing ourselves to the limit.

Our parent company, SpringMicro, has been participating in the web hosting and software game since 2007. We've focused on playing the long game, making sure we don't overextend ourselves on our projects while also maintaining a steady pace. SpringMicroHost is a new iteration of what we've been involved in for many years, and we're going live this April of 2023. Our experience has informed us as to what works and what doesn't in website hosting, and we are committed to delivering the best products we can in 2023 and beyond.

We are not sprinting, we are running an ultra-marathon. And we are not doing it alone. We are hoping that you'll join our team and that together, we can reach our goals of making our little corners of the internet a better place.

David
